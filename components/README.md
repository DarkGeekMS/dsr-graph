# Space for test components using the new DSR

## Basic use-case

We are working on an initial use-case that involves our e-aparment ALab, our robot Viriato and a few agents and components.

Definitions:

- CORTEX, a Robotics Cognitive Architecture based on the idea of a set of sorftware modules sharing a common representation or working memory. 
- G, a distributed graph used as the CORTEX working memory. It exists as the set of local copies held by all the participating components in a CORTEX configuration
- DSR Agent (DA), is a C++ RoboComp component extended with the functionality to edit the distributed graph G.
- Node,
- Edge,
- Atrribute,
